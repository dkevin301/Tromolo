Pushing to GitHub
- Login to GitHub and create a new repository
- Initialize a local git repo in the current local folder that you’re in: git init
- Add file(s) to the local git repo (“.” is a wildcard): git add . 
- Commit your files into your local repo: git commit -m <nameOfCommit>
	Note: Used “Baseline” as <nameOfCommit>. Spaces in between words must be enclosed in single/double quotations
	Update: Found out that -m is also used for entering your commit message
- Add the remote repository (the repository on GitHub has to be created before this step): git remote add <nameOfPush> https://github.com/dkevin301/App01.git 
	Note: Used “origin” as <nameOfPush>
- After this point you can use the <nameOfPush> instead of the URL to get the files
- Push the files up that we want to share onto a specific stream: git push -u <nameOfPush> <nameOfStream>
	Note: Used “origin” as <nameOfPush>
	Note: Used “master” as <nameOfStream>
	Note: “master” has to be used as <nameOfStream> when there is nothing on GitHub
